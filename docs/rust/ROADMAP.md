# Roadmap

What is being worked on in hydrus-rs, what comes next, and what is half
done. Keep it current: when you finish something here, take it out (the
commit, `GUI.md` and `DIFFERENCES.md` say what was done); when you stop
partway, say exactly where.

The owner's current priority (2026-10) is **breadth**: get every major
area of the client working in a first pass, rather than perfecting each
corner before moving on. In order:

1. The manage subscriptions dialog.
2. Manage import folders and export folders.
3. The duplicates page's preparation and auto-resolution tabs.
4. The downloader pages' leftovers.
5. Then the gaps listed under "Later".

The backends for all of these exist. Subscriptions, import and export
folders, duplicates search and auto-resolution all run in `hydrus serve`
and are tested against the reference. The work is the GUI over them.

## 1. Manage subscriptions (network > subscriptions…)

**Done**:

- `oracle/record_subscriptions_list.py` records the reference dialog on
  four subscriptions in varied states. Fixture:
  `oracle/fixtures/subscriptions_list.json`. It holds:
  - the subscriptions list's rows;
  - each subscription's queries' rows;
  - a run of list actions with what each asked and the state after:
    pause/resume, scrub delays, check queries now with its "Check
    which?" prompts, select subscriptions by text, and delete.
- `hydrus-gui-model`:
  - `subscriptions_list` writes the rows: `subscription_row`,
    `query_row`, and the column titles.
  - `subscriptions_dialog` holds the dialog state:
    - `Subscriptions`: the subscriptions held until apply, the sort,
      the selection, the buttons' actions, and the deleted;
    - `CheckNow`: the check-now prompts.
  - Tests: `tests/model/subscriptions_list.rs` replays the recording.
- The window (`ui/subscriptions.slint`, `src/subscriptions_window.rs`),
  opened from network > "subscriptions…".
  - It lists the subscriptions and has delete, pause/resume, scrub
    delays, check queries now (with the prompts, in the window's own
    question panel, `Asking`) and select subscriptions.
  - "apply" writes only what changed.
  - `tests/gui/subscriptions.rs` tests it.
- The edit subscription dialog (`ui/edit_subscription.slint`,
  `src/edit_subscription_window.rs`, `hydrus-gui-model`'s
  `edit_subscription`), opened by "add" and "edit": tested against
  `oracle/fixtures/edit_subscription.json` in
  `tests/model/edit_subscription.rs`, and `tests/gui/edit_subscription.rs`.
  The query editor's additional tags wait on the import options
  editor's tags page.
- The list's other buttons (merge, separate, lowercase, retry, reset,
  overwrite downloader and checker options), recorded by
  `oracle/record_subscriptions_buttons.py` and tested in
  `tests/model/subscriptions_buttons.rs`.

**Next**:

1. The list's last buttons: deduplicate (`DedupeAll`, its questions
   are in the reference's code), "separate"'s "only extract some" (a
   multiple choice), export/import/duplicate, and import options (after
   an import options editor exists).

## 2. Manage import folders / export folders

**Done**: file > import/export folders > "manage import folders…" and
"manage export folders…" (`ui/folders.slint`, `src/folders_window.rs`,
`hydrus-gui-model`'s `folders`), recorded by
`oracle/record_folders_lists.py` and `oracle/record_folders_dialogs.py`,
tested in `tests/model/folders.rs` and `tests/gui/folders.rs`.

**Next**:

- The filename tagging options editor (`EditFilenameTaggingOptionPanel`)
  and the sidecar routers editor, which the import and export folder
  dialogs (and "review files to import") open.
- An import folder's import options, after an import options editor.

## 3. The duplicates page: preparation and auto-resolution tabs

**Done**: the sidebar's three tabs (`ui/duplicates_page.slint`,
`src/duplicates_sidebar.rs`, `hydrus-gui-model`'s `duplicates_page`):
preparation's numbers, distance, working hard and cog menu, and
auto-resolution's rules list, pause/play and resets. Recorded by
`oracle/record_duplicates_preparation.py` and
`oracle/record_auto_resolution_rows.py`; tested in
`tests/model/duplicates_page.rs` and `tests/gui/duplicates_page.rs`.

**Next**:

- The auto-resolution rules editor (`EditDuplicatesAutoResolutionRules
  Panel` and the rule editor with its comparators,
  `ClientGUIDuplicatesAutoResolution.py`), and "review actions"
  (`ClientGUIDuplicatesAutoResolutionRuleReview.py`). Big: record the
  editors' fields and the comparators' labels first.
- The filtering tab's search editor (`EditPotentialDuplicatesSearch
  ContextPanel`) and its "quick and dirty processing" box.

## 4. Downloader pages: leftovers

- Dragging across rows to select.
- The "highlighted" boxes don't show a search's or watcher's own file
  limit and import options.
- The Client API's `/manage_pages/get_page_info` for gallery and watcher
  pages.
- See `DIFFERENCES.md`, "Pages".

## 5. The import options editor

**Done**: the editor for an importer's own options (`ui/import_options.slint`,
`src/import_options_window.rs`, `hydrus-gui-model`'s `import_options_editor`),
recorded by `oracle/record_import_options_editor.py`, opened from the
edit subscription and edit import folder dialogs and gallery and watcher
pages. It edits presentation,
prefetch, file filtering (not yet its filetypes) and locations (one
destination).

**Next**:

- Pages for tags (per tag service: get tags and its filter, additional
  tags, the cog menu's switches), notes and tag filtering (the blacklist
  and whitelist need the tag filter editor and a tags input), and file
  filtering's filetypes (the reference's mimes tree).
- The "highlighted" boxes' import options buttons (a search's or
  watcher's own), the URL downloader and local import pages', and the
  subscriptions list's "import options" button.
- The editor's copy and paste and favourites buttons.

## Later

- **Menu bar.**
  - "clear and load" a session. Already recorded in
    `oracle/fixtures/sessions_menu.json`, including pages that veto
    closing.
  - Menu entries' descriptions in the status bar.
  - network > pause > "nudge subscriptions awake".
- **Options window.** The pages hydrus-rs honours are done. The rest of
  the reference's options wait on the features they configure
  (`DIFFERENCES.md`).
  - `get_client_options` in the Client API should reflect options
    changed in the window.
- **Search page.**
  - The larger system predicate editors that remain.
  - Domain and tag service buttons' remaining cases.
- **Native file picker** for "review files to import": use the `rfd`
  crate, which uses the desktop portal on Linux. This is decided.
- **Testing.**
  - Fuzz/property tests for the parsers that take untrusted input
    (system predicates, Client API parameters, URL parsing).
  - A cargo-mutants sweep of `hydrus-search` and `hydrus-core`.
  - Owed mutation checks:
    - `hydrus-gui`'s downloader lists (commit cd43dd5). The run was
      stopped after a few of its 91 mutants; their one survivor was
      fixed.
    - The subscriptions dialog: 27 survivors in its last run.
      - `subscriptions_dialog`'s `sort_key`: no test sorts by status,
        times, delay or items with data that tells them apart.
      - `DialogQuery::latest_added` and `can_reset`: no test selects
        only the subscription with no queries.
      - `CheckNow`'s filter of paused subscriptions' queries.
      - The ">" and ">=" boundaries of the time texts in
        `subscriptions_list`.
      - `subscriptions_window`'s `changes`: no test applies with a name
        or a query unchanged.
      - Its `now`.
